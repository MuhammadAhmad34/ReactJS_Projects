## About ReactJS

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and build complex web applications with ease. React's component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools make it a powerful choice for front-end development.
